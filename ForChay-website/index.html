    <h2>My Unspoken Truth </h2>
    <p>Hey Chay,</p>
    <p>I once told you that even if I fall, it would be my unspoken truth. Well, here's the truth.. </p>
    <p>I've been thinking about you a lot lately, and strangely, you even appeared in my dreams hehe. </p>
    <p>On June 7, I told you I liked you, and that feeling has only grown stronger. I'm falling for you.</p>
    <p> And if you'll gonna ask for reasons again, here's why:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I love your infectious laugh</li>
        <li>I love the way you perceive things</li>
        <li>I love your gentle voice</li>
        <li>I love watching you smile and giggle</li>
        <li>I love the way you listen to me</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Actually, I love everything about you Chay. And even if those reasons kay magchange,I know my feelings won't change.</p>
    <p>Everything about you is very addicting to me, not in a bad way ah? Ganado kaayo ako day Chay because of you</p>
    <p>I never stop getting excited to see your messages bisan everyday ta gatalk, and I could stare at you for hours.</p>
    <p>I'd be lying if I'll say I'm not scared of doing this because I might lose you.</p>
    <p>But I'll be taking that risk. So..</p>
